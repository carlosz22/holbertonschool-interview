# Project: Heap Insert
## 0x02-heap_insert

## Problem Statement

### 0. New node

This function creates a binary tree node.

When created, a node does not have any children.

The function returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.

### 1. Heap - Insert

This function inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap.

The function writes a pointer to the inserted node, or NULL on failure.

If the address stored in root is NULL, the created node becomes the root node.

It respects a Max Heap ordering.
